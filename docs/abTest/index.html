      The question this tool helps to answer is whether a difference between two or more small trials is significant.
      Rather than use numerical methods, it simply draws the relevant distributions on the same display.
      The less the distributions overlap, the more confident we can be that they are significantly different.
      Small numbers of trials tend to be wide and chunky. Larger trials produce narrower, taller distributions.
    </p><p>
      This tool uses the Monte Carlo method to calculate distributions based on the given ratio of trials to wins.
      There are better ways of doing this that create smoother curves, but my motivation was to keep the maths
      within easy reach of those who (like myself) are not exactly fluent in statistical methods.
      For the curious, I recommend checking out the link at the top of the page.
    </p><p>
      More specifically, the tool creates a distribution by picking random samples with replacement of the given ratios.
      Imagine that the trials represent a number of red or green marbles in a jar, and the wins are the number of green marbles.
      Imagine there are 20 marbles in the jar. If we select a marble at random 20 times, replacing the marble after each draw,
      we might draw a different marble each time. Or we might draw the same one 20 times. Or somewhere in between.
      In any case, the series of draws will give us a number of green marbles, somewhere between 0 and 20.
      By repeating this series over many thousands of times, the tool can create a distribution showing the likelihood of
      drawing a given number of greens ('wins').
    </p><p>
      Each distribution is scaled to fit across the full width of the plot.
      The height of each plot is scaled down by the same amount, so that the area under each plot remains constant.
      This allows us to look at the overlapping area of different distributions in a meaningful way. 
    </p><p>
      The tool can handle fairly large trials, but expect the calculation to be slow if much over 2000.
      The exact values I used here are more a product of trial-and-error to compromise between speed and smooth distributions.
      As it stands, recalculating using the same trial/win values will produce a different distribution each time.
      But for crude comparison purposes, it does provide a useful relative measure.
