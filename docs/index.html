        <h3>Comparison Tools</h3>
        <p>When running a series of A-B tests, I found that it took a long time to get enough data points to reach a statistically significant conclusion. I wanted a way to see what the tests were signalling even with a small data-set. These apps represent a way to visualise the results of two or more tests, to see if there really is any difference between them.</p>
        <p><a href="./abTest/index.html">The first tool</a> creates bell-curves based on ratios of trials:wins. It is useful to see how much the curves overlap, giving an intuition for where the data might be heading.</p>
        <p><a href="./boxPlot/index.html">The comparitive box-plot tool</a> uses box and whisker plots to display different (small) data sets on the same axis. The idea is to make differences more apparent even with a small set of numbers.</p>

        <h3>Chart Editing Tools</h3>
        <p>At one point during a project, I needed a way to make diagrams of code designs using simple text-based descriptions. I wanted to include the diagram definition in source code comments, while also auto-creating diagrams.</p>
        <p><a href="./chartEdit/stateChartEdit.html">This tool</a> uses a very simple textual definition of a state machine based on the Sketch Systems input format. It then converts the definition into the DOT format, suitable for use in GraphViz for rendering as an image.</p>
        <p><a href="./chartEdit/structureChartEdit.html">This tool</a> does a similar thing, but for a hierarchical structure. Representation is simply by nested indents, similar to YAML formats.</p>

        <h3>Linear Equations Tool</h3>
        <p>I created <a href="./gaussJordan/index.html">this simple tool</a> for using row reduction to solve systems of linear equations. The tool uses basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Row_operations" target="_blank">row operations</a> on a matrix, which makes rearranging the equations much simpler.</p>
