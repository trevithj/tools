        <h1>Tools: Home Page</h1>

        <h3>Sudoku Helper Tool</h3>
        <p><a href="./sudoku/index.html">This is an older tool</a>, created to be ES2015-compliant, but recently updated. Fairly self-explanatory, it has a "working" view that visualises possible values for a given cell based on existing entries.</p>

        <h3>Comparison Tools</h3>
        <p>When running a series of A-B tests, I found that it took a long time to get enough data points to reach a statistically significant conclusion. I wanted a way to see what the tests were signalling even with a small data-set. These apps represent a way to visualise the results of two or more tests, to see if there really is any difference between them.</p>
        <p><a href="./abTest/index.html">The first tool</a> creates bell-curves based on ratios of trials:wins. It is useful to see how much the curves overlap, giving an intuition for where the data might be heading.</p>
        <p><a href="./boxPlot/index.html">The comparitive box-plot tool</a> uses box and whisker plots to display different (small) data sets on the same axis. The idea is to make differences more apparent even with a small set of numbers.</p>

        <h3>Chart Editing Tools</h3>
        <p>At one point during a project, I needed a way to make diagrams of code designs using simple text-based descriptions. I wanted to include the diagram definition in source code comments, while also auto-creating diagrams.</p>
        <p><a href="./chartEdit/stateChartEdit.html">This tool</a> uses a very simple textual definition of a state machine based on the Sketch Systems input format. It then converts the definition into the DOT format, suitable for use in GraphViz for rendering as an image.</p>
        <p><a href="./chartEdit/structureChartEdit.html">This tool</a> does a similar thing, but for a hierarchical structure. Representation is simply by nested indents, similar to YAML formats.</p>

        <h3>Linear Equations Tool</h3>
        <p>I created <a href="./gaussJordan/index.html">this simple tool</a> for using row reduction to solve systems of linear equations. The tool uses basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Row_operations" target="_blank">row operations</a> on a matrix, which makes rearranging the equations much simpler.</p>

        <h3>Colour Extrapolation Tool</h3>
        <p>I created <a href="./colourBars/index.html">this simple tool</a> as a way to explore simple linear colour extrapolation. Turns out colour extrapolation is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14482226/how-can-i-get-the-color-halfway-between-two-colors">a complicated subject</a>. However, the tool can be interesting to play with as a way of checking your own colour-sensitivity, by seeing how well you can distinguish between the different adjacent colours.</p>
        <p>And <a href="./colourBarsHSL/index.html">this version of the tool</a> uses the HSL colour coding, which gives much nicer results. I also used simple roll-your-own components to create the slider controls. This made detecting updates much simpler, so the tool is nicely performant.</p>

        <h3>Random Sequence Generator Tool</h3>
        <p><a href="./random/index.html">This tool</a> was inspired by a need to easily generate complex passwords, while still being able to remember them. The idea is that a seed value is easier to remember than a long sequence of characters. Also, one seed can generate multiple variations, and only the index of each sub-sequence need be noted.</p>
        <p>Not intended for weapons-grade security, of course. But an interesting exercise in implementing a pseudo-random number generator.</p>
