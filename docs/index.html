        <h1>Tools: Home Page</h1>
        <h3>Trial Comparison</h3>
        <p><a href="./abTest/index.html">This tool</a> helps compare two or more small-sample trails by displaying a graphical representation of the respective trial:win ratios. The idea is to give a feel for how different the results really are, for cases where the usual statistical tests are unsuitable.</p>
        <h3>Comparative Box Plots</h3>
        <p><a href="./boxPlot/index.html">This tool</a> allows comparison of two or more small data-sets using box and whisker plots to display the results on the same axis. The idea is to make differences more apparent even with a small set of numbers.</p>

        <h3>Chart Editing Tools</h3>
        <p>At one point during a project, I needed a way to make diagrams of code designs using simple text-based descriptions. I wanted to include the diagram definition in source code comments, while also auto-creating diagrams.</p>
        <p><a href="./chartEdit/stateChartEdit.html">This tool</a> uses a very simple textual definition of a state machine based on the Sketch Systems input format. It then converts the definition into the DOT format, suitable for use in GraphViz for rendering as an image.</p>
        <p><a href="./chartEdit/structureChartEdit.html">This tool</a> does a similar thing, but for a hierarchical structure. Representation is simply by nested indents, similar to YAML formats.</p>
