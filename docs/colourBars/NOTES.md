# Colour-Bar tool
Tool for creating a series of colour bars, with variable graduations of colour.

Extrapolation between colours, plus see how good we are at telling similar colours apart.

## IOs
1. I don't know how to extrapolate between two arbitrary colours.
2. How do I use JS to set the colour style of an element anyway?
3. How do I convert between hex and decimal?
4. I don't have a UI design yet.

## Task list
[x] 1. Check Perplexity for extrapolation. Write a test?
[x] 2. Consult MDN and document summary.
[x] 3. Write a test, then figure it out.
[x] 4. Mock-up an index page with basic controls.
